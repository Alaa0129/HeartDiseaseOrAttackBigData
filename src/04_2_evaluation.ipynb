    "## Evaluation Metrics - look up\n",
    "A 'quick' recap from Bruce & Bruce and [machinelearningmastery.com](https://machinelearningmastery.com/metrics-evaluate-machine-learning-algorithms-python//):\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color= Orchid>Accuracy</font>**<br>\n",
    "The percent (or proportion) of cases classified correctly. Being the most common evaluation metric for classification problems, it is also the most misused. It is really only suitable when there are an equal number of observations in each class. Why is this? Think of a dataset on sunny days in Hawaii. The distribution of sunny vs. not-sunny days would probably be quite unbalanced (e.g., 95% sunny days and 5% not-sunny days). A classifier model trying to predict whether a day will be sunny could receive a very high accuracy by simply always predicting the biggest class (sunny). As such, the accuracy metric does not reflect the model's ability to correctly classificy the smallest class (not-sunny days).\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the accuracy metric 'assumes' that all predictions and prediction errors are equally important. What do we mean by this? Imagine that we are trying to predict a medical condition. Here, we might have a model which is overall pretty accurate. However, when we take a closer look at the model, we see that there is a lot of 'false negatives' (i.e., patients being misclassified as healthy although they actually have the diagnosis). This misclassification is much more critical than a 'false positive' (i.e., a patient being classified as having the condition, although they are healthy). The accuracy metric itself does not account for this, but treats all false predictions equally. However, as the example shows, certain types of errors might be more costly or harmful than others. The metrics below are ways to address the limitations of the accuracy metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color= Orchid>Confusion matrix</font>**<br>\n",
    "A tabular display (2×2 in the binary case) of the record counts by their predicted and actual classification status. In other words, it shows the amount of true positive and true negative predictions as well as false positive and false negative predictions made by the model. What does these terms mean? Think of our IBM classification model predicting attrition (i.e. whether an employee will leave the company). In this dataset, the value '1' means 'true' = the employee did leave the company, while the value '0' means 'false' = the employee did not leave the company:\n",
    "- We say a prediction is a *<font color= Orchid>true positive</font>* when the model predicts '1' and the correct class is indeed '1' (the employee actually left the company). \n",
    "- We say a prediction is a *<font color= Orchid>true negative</font>*, when the model predicts '0' and the correct class is indeed '0' (the employee did not leave). \n",
    "- Similarly, a *<font color= Orchid>false positive</font>* prediction is when the model predicts '1', when the correct class is actually '0' (i.e., the employee is predicted to have left the company, but in fact did not leave). \n",
    "- A *<font color= Orchid>false negative</font>* prediction is when the model predicts '0', when the correct class is actually '1' (i.e., the employee is predicted to stay, but in fact left the comapny).\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color= Orchid>Recall</font>** - minimizing false negatives <br>\n",
    "This metric is also called sensitivity or 'true positive rate'. It signifies the percent (or proportion) of all '1's that are correctly classified as '1's. In other words, it answers the question: <font color= Orchid>*\"Of all the instances in the test data that belong to '1', how many did the model correctly predict as '1'?\"</font>*. In the case of the IBM dataset, we take all the employees that left the company and calculate how many the model predicted correctly as having left the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall is particularly useful in situations where the cost of missing a positive instance (i.e., making a false negative prediction) is high. For example, in medical diagnostics, as described above, recall tells us the percentage of all actual patients with the disease that the model correctly identifies as having the disease. Thus, a high recall means the model is effectively identifying a large portion of patients with a certain condition, minimizing the number of cases where the condition goes undetected. We can optimize our models for high recall, which means that we focus on minimizing false negatives. However, we must be mindful that this may come at the expense of precision (see below), as the model may classify more instances as positive, including some that are actually negative. In other words, a model with high recall may classify more patients as having the condition when they are in fact healthy. \n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color= Orchid>Precision</font>** - minimizing false positives <br>\n",
    "The percent (proportion) of true positives (instances predicted as '1', which are in fact '1') out of all the positive predictions made by the model. It answers the question: *<font color= Orchid>\"Of all the instances in the test data predicted as '1' by the model, how many in this group are in fact '1'?\"*</font>. In the case of the IBM dataset, we take all the employees that was predicted to have left the company and assess how many of these in fact left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision helps us to assess whether the positive predictions made by our model are accurate. High precision indicates that the model makes fewer false positive predictions, minimizing the number of instances incorrectly classified as positive. It is important in situations where false positives have high costs or consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color= Orchid>Recall vs. Precision</font>**<br>\n",
    "In recall, we first *<font color= Orchid>group together all the positive instances</font>* in our test dataset and then, we figure out how many of these have been correctly predicted as positive by our model. (Recall: How many of the positive items were identified correctly?)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In precision, we first *<font color= Orchid>group together all the instances that our model predicted to be positive</font>* and then, we figure out how many of these were in fact positive. (Precision: How many of the items predicted to be positive are actually positive?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color= Orchid>Specificity</font>* <br>\n",
    "The percent (or proportion) of all 0s that are correctly classified as 0s. It measures the ability of a model to correctly identify negative instances (true negatives) out of all actual negative instances.  In other words, specificity answers the question: *<font color= Orchid>\"Of all the instances that truly belong to the negative class, how many did the model correctly predict as negative?\"</font>*. While recall measures the model's ability to identify positive instances, specificity complements this by measuring the model's ability to identify negative instances. A high specificity value indicates that the model is good at avoiding false positives and accurately classifying negative instances. Conversely, a low specificity value suggests that the model is incorrectly classifying negative instances as positive, leading to false alarms. To return to our medical example, if specificity is high, it means the model is good at correctly identifying healthy patients as healthy, minimizing the number of healthy patients mistakenly classified as having a disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color= Orchid>Area Under ROC curve</font>** <br>\n",
    "Is also called AUC-ROC for short. The AUC-ROC score ranges from 0 to 1 where:\n",
    "- AUC-ROC = 1 indicates a perfect classifier that achieves perfect separation between positive and negative instances.\n",
    "- AUC-ROC = 0.5 indicates a classifier that performs no better than random guessing.\n",
    "- AUC-ROC < 0.5 indicates a classifier that performs worse than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it's a number that tells you how well your model can separate positive cases from negative cases overall. The higher the AUC-ROC, the better the model is at this task. If the AUC-ROC is 1, it means the model is perfect. If it's 0.5, it's no better than flipping a coin.\n",
    "It is a great performance metric for binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, the ROC curve is pictured. The AUC-ROC is like a summary score for this graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"roc.jpg\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color= Orchid>F1 curve</font>** <br>\n",
    "The F1 score is a single metric that combines both precision and recall into one value, providing a balanced measure of a model's performance, especially in situations where there is an imbalance between the classes. In words, the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The harmonic mean gives more weight to low values. This means that the F1 score will be high only if both precision and recall are high.\n",

Over- and under-sampling are techniques used in machine learning to address class imbalance in the dataset, where one class is significantly underrepresented compared to the other class. We will only introduce you to two undersampling and two oversampling techniques and a combination of two sampling techniqes - there exist other, maybe even better, techniques, so don't feel constrained by this notebook and feel free to explore om your own!\n",
